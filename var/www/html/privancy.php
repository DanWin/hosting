<br>
Data protection is of a particularly high priority for Lin Hu. The use of the Internet pages of Lin Hu is possible without any indication of personal data. 
However, if a data subject wants to use services via my website, processing of personal data could become necessary. 
If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, I generally obtain consent from the data subject.
<br><br>
The processing of personal data, such as the name, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with EU's data protection regulations. By means of this data protection declaration, I would like to inform the general 
public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data I collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration,
of the rights to which they are entitled.
<br><br>
As the controller, Lin Hu has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. 
For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to me via alternative means, e.g. by mail.
<br><br>
1. Definitions<br>
The data protection declaration of Lin Hu is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
My data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as my users. 
To ensure this, I would like to first explain the terminology used.
<br><br>
In this data protection declaration, I use, inter alia, the following terms:<br>
a) Personal data
<br><br>
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). 
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, 
an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity of that natural person.<br>
b) Data subject
<br><br>
Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.<br>
c) Processing
<br><br>
Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, 
such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, 
dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.<br>
d) Restriction of processing
<br><br>
Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.<br>
e) Profiling
<br><br>
Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, 
in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, 
behaviour, location or movements.<br>
f) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
<br><br>
Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, 
determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, 
the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.<br>
g) Processor
<br><br>
Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.<br>
h) Recipient
<br><br>
Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. 
However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be 
regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the 
purposes of the processing.<br>
i) Third party
<br><br>
Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority 
of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.<br>
j) Consent
<br><br>
Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear 
affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.<br>
2. Name and Address of the controller
<br><br>
Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other 
provisions related to data protection is:
<br><br>
Lin Hu

3. Cookies
<br><br>
The Internet pages of Lin Hu use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
<br><br>
Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. 
It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. 
This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. 
A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
<br><br>
Through the use of cookies, Lin Hu can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
<br><br>
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on my website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow me, as previously mentioned, to recognize my website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize my website. An example for the use of a cookie is when you login to the mail client, chat or hosting dashboard. The cookie assures that you stay logged in with your account.
<br><br>
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through my website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, 
and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. 
This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of my website 
may be entirely usable.
<br><br>
4. Collection of general data and information
<br><br>
The website of Lin Hu collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. <br>
This general data and information are stored in the server log files. <br>
Collected may be <br>
(1) the browser types and versions used, 
(2) the operating system used by the accessing system, 
(3) the website from which an accessing system reaches my website (so-called referrers), 
(4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, 
(6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), and 
(7) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on my information technology systems.
<br><br>
When using these general data and information, Lin Hu does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of my website correctly, (2) optimize the content of my website, (3) ensure the long-term viability of my information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, I analyze anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of my website, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data I process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
<br><br>
5. Registration on my website
<br><br>
The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.
<br><br>
By registering on the website of the controleter, date and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of my services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
<br><br>
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
<br><br>
The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.
<br>
6. Contact possibility via the website
<br><br>
The website of Lin Hu contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to me, as well as direct communication with me, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.
<br>
7. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
<br><br>
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
<br><br>
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely erased in accordance with legal requirements.
<br>
8. Rights of the data subject
a) Right of confirmation
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail themself of this right of confirmation, they may, at any time, contact the controller.
b) Right of access
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about their personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:
<br><br>
    the purposes of the processing<br>
    the categories of personal data concerned<br>
    the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations<br>
    where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period<br>
    the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing<br>
    the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority<br>
    where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source<br>
    the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
<br><br>
If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, they may, at any time, contact the controller.
c) Right to rectification
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning them. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
<br><br>
If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, they may, at any time, contact the controller.
d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:
<br><br>
    The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.<br>
    The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.<br>
    The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.<br>
    The personal data have been unlawfully processed.<br>
    The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.<br>
    The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.
<br><br>
If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by Lin Hu, they may, at any time, contact the controller. Lin Hu shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
<br><br>
Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. Daniel Winzen will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.
e) Right of restriction of processing
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
<br><br>
    The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.<br>
    The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.<br>
    The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.<br>
    The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
<br><br>
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by Lin Hu, they may at any time contact the controller. Lin Hu will arrange the restriction of the processing.
f) Right to data portability
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning them, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. They shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
<br><br>
Furthermore, in exercising their right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
<br><br>
In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact Lin Hu.
g) Right to object
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning them, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
<br><br>
Lin Hu shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless I can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
<br><br>
In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to their particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning them by Lin Hu for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
<br><br>
In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact me. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use their right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.
<br><br>
If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, Lin Hu shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.
<br><br>
If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, they may, at any time, contact Lin Hu.
i) Right to withdraw data protection consent
<br><br>
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw their consent to processing of their personal data at any time.
<br><br>
If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, they may, at any time, contact Lin Hu.
9. Legal basis for the processing
<br><br>
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which I obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary to provide services, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning my services. If I am subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by me or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
10. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
<br><br>
Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR my legitimate interest is to carry out my business in favor of the well-being of all my data subjects and myself.
11. Period for which the personal data will be stored
<br><br>
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
12. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
<br><br>
I clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
13. Existence of automated decision-making
<br><br>
I do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.
